# everPay Tx records on arweave
For every everPay deposit transaction, everPay will monitor it, and after confirming the number of corresponding blocks, it will generate an everPay `'mint'` Tx transaction through everPay team's wallet and record it on the arweave blockchain.

The everPay Tx signature generation rules are described in [everPay transactions](../everpay-tx)
